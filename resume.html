      <h1>Mission</h1>
      <p><em>Some people told me I was crazy</em> to become an engineering manager. I heard this most frequently from other managers, who groused that the software industry only rewards technical skill. From my perspective, new technical skills are always interesting to learn and apply, but by far the most rewarding experiences in my career have all been about helping other engineers. I think I'm lucky to have the opportunity to build, mentor and support teams of engineers at all experience levels, who I can learn from.</p>
