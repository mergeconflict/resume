      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p><em>Software engineer seeking a new career as a high school teacher</em>. In over 18 years in the software industry, the times when I've most strongly felt I'd done something of real value were those when I helped people learn. I've been lucky to find occasional teaching opportunities through my work — either as an instructor, a mentor, a manager or even as a peer — but I believe I can have a much greater positive impact and more personal satisfaction by committing myself to public education.</p>
